[Molecular tagging approach](http://www.pnas.org/content/108/23/9530) has revolutionized the field of high depth genome re-sequencing 
by allowing detection of ultra-rare mutations. This pipeline aims at filling the gap in software for analysis of UMI-tagged data. 
MAGERI implements consensus assembly, alignment and variant calling and allows to process 
datasets into ready SAM and VCF files in a single command. Its main purpose is to analyze targeted region genome re-sequencing data for tumor heterogeneity and circulating tumor DNA studies, however it can be also applied to other tasks that require accurate rare variant detection.
