MAGERI: Molecular tAgged GEnome Re-sequencing pIpeline
======================================================

    :align: center

MAGERI is an all-in-one software for analysis of targeted genome re-sequencing data for libraries prepared with 
novel unique molecular identifier tagging technology. Starting from raw sequencing reads, MAGERI extracts UMI 
sequences, performes primer and adapter matching and trimming, assembles molecular consensuses, alignes them to 
reference sequences and calls variants. MAGERI output is provided in conventional SAM and VCF formats, so it can 
be browsed and post-processed by the majority of conventional bioinformatics software.
    
Terminology
-----------

- UMI - unique molecular identifier, a short (typically 6-20nt) degenerate nucleotide sequence, that is attach to cDNA/DNA molecules in order to trace them throughout the entire experiment.
- Sample barcode - a short specific nucleotide sequence used to mark cDNA/DNA molecules that correspond to a given sample in a pooled sequencing library
- MIG - molecular identifier group, a set of reads or read pairs that have an identical UMI sequence
- MIG consensus - the consensus sequence of MIG, calculated from MIG position-weight matrix by taking the letter with highest frequency at each position
- CQS - consensus quality score, calculated as the maximal relative nucleotide frequency at a given PWM position. Usually scaled to [2, 40] range to fit Phred33 string representation. Indicates our confidence in the consensus sequence at a given position.
- Major variant (aka dominant variant, supermutant) - a sequence variant that is present in MIG consensus sequence
- Minor variant - a sequence variant that is present in reads within an MIG, but doesnâ€™t get to the final MIG consensus sequence
